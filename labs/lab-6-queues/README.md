# Queue Lab - Interactive Learning

## üìö What You'll Build

In this hands-on lab, you'll build a complete interactive Queue<T> application featuring an IT Support Desk Queue system with ticket management functionality. This is a real-world application pattern used in help desk software, call centers, and many other systems!

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- **Understand FIFO behavior** - First In, First Out through hands-on building
- **Master core queue operations** - `Enqueue`, `Dequeue`, `Peek`, `Clear`
- **Build proper safety patterns** - Guard logic for empty queue scenarios
- **Create interactive applications** - Menu-driven console interface for ticket management
- **Implement queue-based workflows** - Realistic support desk operations
- **Display data effectively** - Show queue contents in FIFO order
- **Apply real-world concepts** - Recognize when to use queues vs stacks vs other data structures
- **Handle ticket priorities** - Basic priority queue concepts (advanced feature)

## üé™ Getting Started

### What You Have

- **`QueueStarter.cs`** - Your starting point with step-by-step TODO guidance and pre-defined ticket options
- **Quick Reference Guide** - Built into the skeleton file with Queue<T> operations and helpful patterns

### Your Mission

Follow along with your instructor to build each method step-by-step. You'll start with TODO method stubs that guide you through implementing a complete, working IT Support Desk application with professional features!

## üìã What You'll Build Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Foundation (Step 1)

- **Set up your queue variables** - Declare your Queue<SupportTicket>, counters, and session tracking
- **Note:** The main program loop and menu system are already provided for you!

### Phase 2: Core Operations (Steps 2-4)

- **HandleSubmitTicket** - Add tickets to your queue with validation and pre-defined quick-select options
- **HandleProcessTicket** - Remove tickets safely with proper error handling and detailed feedback
- **HandlePeekNext** - Look at the next ticket without removing it

### Phase 3: Display & Management (Steps 5-6)

- **HandleDisplayQueue** - Show your ticket queue in FIFO order with position numbers and visual indicators
- **HandleClearQueue** - Reset your queue with user confirmation

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Steps 7-8)

- **HandleUrgentTicket** - Add priority tickets with special identification
- **HandleSearchTicket** - Find specific tickets by ID or description keywords

### Phase 5: Working Features

- **HandleQueueStatistics** - Already implemented! Shows session metrics and priority breakdowns
- **ShowSessionSummary** - Already implemented! Provides farewell message with final stats

## üîë Key Concepts You'll Learn

### Interactive Application Structure

You'll build a menu-driven application using this pattern:

```csharp
// Main program loop pattern with multiple input methods
bool running = true;
while (running) {
    DisplayMenu(); // Shows real-time queue status
    string choice = Console.ReadLine()?.ToLower() ?? "";
    // Handle user choice with switch statement (numbers and keywords)
}
```

### The Support Desk Queue Pattern

Learn how professional help desk systems process tickets:

```csharp
// Queue working with support tickets
Queue<SupportTicket> ticketQueue = new Queue<SupportTicket>();

// When ticket arrives: enqueue to back of line
// When technician ready: dequeue from front of line
// First ticket submitted = First ticket processed (FIFO)

// Professional features
string ticketId = $"T{ticketCounter:D3}"; // T001, T002, T003...
var ticket = new SupportTicket(ticketId, description, "Normal", "User");
```

### Essential Safety Pattern

Always protect your queue operations:

```csharp
// CRITICAL: Always guard Dequeue() and Peek() operations
if (queue.Count > 0) {
    SupportTicket ticket = queue.Dequeue();
    // Safe to process ticket
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("‚ùå No tickets in queue to process!");
}

// Teaching point: Same safety rule as Stack's Pop() and Peek()
```

### FIFO in Action

See the First In, First Out principle work:

```csharp
// Enqueue: Ticket A, Ticket B, Ticket C (C is at back)
// Dequeue order: A, B, C (First In, First Out)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch Out For These Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting guard clauses** - Always check `Count > 0` before `Dequeue()` or `Peek()`
2. **Expecting random access** - Queues only let you work with the front item (unlike arrays)
3. **FIFO confusion** - Remember: First ticket submitted is first ticket processed
4. **Poor error handling** - Always give users clear feedback when operations can't be performed
5. **Input validation** - Don't forget to validate user input (empty strings, invalid menu choices)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Follow Along

1. **Start with `QueueStarter.cs`** - Your instructor will guide you through each TODO step
2. **Code along actively** - Don't just watch, type the code yourself for muscle memory!
3. **Test frequently** - Run your application after each major step to see it working
4. **Use the quick-select options** - Pre-defined tickets (1-5) speed up testing and demos
5. **Ask questions** - If something doesn't make sense, ask immediately
6. **Use the Quick Reference** - The guide at the top of your file has all the Queue<T> operations

## üß™ Testing Your Code

As you build each method, test your application by running:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Try these test scenarios:

- **Submit several tickets** - Use quick-select options (1-5) for "Login Issues", "Password Reset", "Software Install"
- **Process tickets** - Remove them and see the FIFO order with detailed feedback
- **Try empty operations** - Process from empty queue to see error handling
- **Test urgent tickets** - Submit priority tickets with "U" prefix and see queue management
- **Use search functionality** - Find tickets by ID ("T001") or keyword ("login")
- **Check statistics** - View your session stats and priority breakdowns throughout development
- **Test edge cases** - Empty inputs, invalid menu choices, clearing empty queues

## üéØ Success Checklist

- ‚úÖ Have proper queue variables declared (Step 1)
- ‚úÖ Submit tickets to a queue with validation and quick-select options (Step 2)
- ‚úÖ Process tickets safely with proper error messages and detailed feedback (Step 3)
- ‚úÖ Peek at the next ticket without modifying the queue (Step 4)

## üîß Development Environment Tips

### Visual Studio Code

- Use the integrated terminal: `Ctrl+`` (backtick)
- Install C# Dev Kit extension for better IntelliSense
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` then "C#: Restart OmniSharp" if IntelliSense stops working

### Visual Studio (Full)

- Create new Console App targeting .NET 9.0
- Use `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging
- Set breakpoints to step through your code

### Online Environments

- All code works in standard .NET environments like Repl.it
- Some online terminals may require pressing Enter instead of any key for `Console.ReadKey()`
