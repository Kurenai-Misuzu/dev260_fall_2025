## Quick Reference for Development

**Due Date:** November 5, 2024 by 11:59 PM  
**Total Points:** 105 (110 with extra credit)

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- **Apply queue patterns** learned in Lab 6 to solve real-world problems
- **Implement multi-queue systems** with different matching strategies
- **Handle skill-based matching** with filtering and validation
- **Design clean user interfaces** for console applications

- **Ranked Mode:** Players within ¬±2 skill levels can match
- **QuickPlay Mode:** Prefer skill matching, but allow broader matching for speed

### 3. Match Processing

- Pair players appropriately based on game mode
- Simulate match outcomes with skill-based probability
- Update player statistics after matches

### 4. User Interface

- Interactive menu system
- Clear display of queue status and player information
- Professional error messages and confirmations

## ‚≠ê Stretch Features (Extra Credit - Choose ONE)

**Pick ONE of these three options for extra credit (5 points):**

### Option 1: Team Formation (2v2 Matches)

- Implement 2v2 team matches instead of 1v1
- Balance teams based on combined skill ratings
- Handle team formation logic and display

### Option 2: Avoid Recent Opponents System

- Track recent match history for each player
- Prevent matching players who played together recently
- Implement a "cooldown" period before rematches

### Option 3: Advanced Queue Analytics

- Track detailed queue time statistics
- Display average wait times per game mode
- Show peak usage times and queue efficiency metrics

---

## üîß Implementation Requirements

You will implement **6 key methods** in the `MatchmakingSystem` class:

### Core Matchmaking Methods:

- `AddToQueue(Player player, GameMode mode)` - Add players to appropriate queues
- `TryCreateMatch(GameMode mode)` - Create matches based on mode rules
- `ProcessMatch(Match match)` - Handle match outcomes and stat updates

### Display & Management Methods:

- `DisplayQueueStatus()` - Show all queue information with formatting
- `DisplayPlayerStats(Player player)` - Show detailed player information
- `GetQueueEstimate(GameMode mode)` - Calculate estimated wait times

_All other classes and UI components are provided - focus on these core methods!_

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

Your application must handle these scenarios:

### Basic Matchmaking Tests

- Create multiple players with different skill levels
- Add players to different queues
- Process matches and verify correct pairing
- Check that statistics update properly

### Game Mode Tests

- **Casual:** Any players should match regardless of skill
- **Ranked:** Only players within ¬±2 skill levels should match
- **QuickPlay:** Prefer skill matching but allow broader matching

### Edge Case Tests

- Try to create matches with empty queues
- Single player in queue (no match possible)
- All players same skill level in ranked
- Queue status display with various queue states

3. Implement QuickPlay mode matching (hybrid approach)
4. Add guard clauses and error handling

### Phase 3: Match Processing & Statistics

1. Implement win probability calculation based on skill
2. Add match outcome processing and stat updates
3. Implement skill rating adjustments
4. Add match history tracking

### Phase 4: Display & Polish

1. Implement queue status display with formatting
2. Implement detailed player statistics display

## üîç Research and Problem Solving

**No external resources or links are provided intentionally!** This assignment is designed to encourage you to develop essential programming research skills.

**When you get stuck, GOOGLE IT!** This is a critical skill for any developer. Examples of effective searches:

- `"How to iterate through a queue in C#"`
- `"C# Queue<T> peek without removing"`
- `"C# switch statement with enum"`
- `"How to remove specific item from Queue C#"`
- `"C# LINQ where clause filtering"`

**Remember:** Stack Overflow, Microsoft Docs, and C# documentation are your friends. Learning to find solutions independently is just as important as implementing them!

## üí° Tips for Success

### Understanding the Matchmaking Model

- **Casual Queue:** Fair FIFO processing, any skill levels
- **Ranked Queue:** Competitive matching within skill ranges
- **QuickPlay Queue:** Balance between speed and fairness

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Forgetting skill range validation** in Ranked mode
- **Not handling empty queues** properly
- **Incorrect probability calculations** for match outcomes
- **Poor user feedback** for queue status

### Testing Strategy

- Create players with varied skill levels (1, 3, 5, 7, 10)
- Test each queue mode independently
- Verify skill-based matching works correctly
- Test edge cases thoroughly
