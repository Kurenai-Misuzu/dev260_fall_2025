# Assignment 6: Game Matchmaking System

## üéÆ Overview

Build a **Game Matchmaking System** that simulates how online games pair players for matches using queues! This assignment applies the Queue<T> concepts from Lab 6 to create a real-world application that mimics game matchmaking behavior with skill-based matching and multiple game modes.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

- **Apply queue patterns** learned in Lab 6 to solve real-world problems
- **Implement multi-queue systems** with different matching strategies
- **Handle skill-based matching** with filtering and validation
- **Design clean user interfaces** for console applications
- **Practice game industry patterns** used in actual matchmaking systems
- **Implement stretch features** like team formation and advanced statistics

## üìã Requirements Overview

### Core Features (Required)

1. **Player Management System**

   - Create players with username and skill rating (1-10)
   - Track wins, losses, and skill rating adjustments
   - Display player statistics and profiles

2. **Multi-Queue Matchmaking**

   - Three game modes: Casual, Ranked, and QuickPlay
   - Different matching strategies per queue
   - Skill-based filtering for Ranked mode

3. **Match Processing**

   - Balance teams based on combined skill ratings
   - Handle team formation logic and display

2. **Avoid Recent Opponents System**

   - Track recent match history for each player
   - Prevent matching players who played together recently

3. **Advanced Queue Analytics**
   - Track detailed queue time statistics
   - Display average wait times per game mode
   - Show peak usage times and queue efficiency metrics

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Core Classes

The assignment includes these key components:

- **`MatchmakingSystem`** - Main class managing queues and matches (you implement core methods)
- **`Player`** - Represents a player with stats and preferences (provided)
- **`Match`** - Represents a completed match with players and outcome (provided)
- **`GameNavigator`** - Handles the interactive menu and user commands (provided)
- **`Program`** - Entry point and application orchestration (provided)

### Data Structures

```csharp
// Main matchmaking queues
Queue<Player> casualQueue = new Queue<Player>();
Queue<Player> rankedQueue = new Queue<Player>();
Queue<Player> quickPlayQueue = new Queue<Player>();
List<Player> allPlayers = new List<Player>();
List<Match> matchHistory = new List<Match>();
```

### Key Operations

1. **Add to Queue**: Add player to appropriate queue based on game mode
2. **Create Match**: Find compatible players and create matches
3. **Process Match**: Simulate match outcome and update player stats
4. **Display Queues**: Show current queue status with wait times
5. **Player Statistics**: Track and display comprehensive player metrics

## üéØ Implementation Requirements

You will need to implement **6 key methods** in the `MatchmakingSystem` class:

### Core Matchmaking Methods

- `AddToQueue(Player player, GameMode mode)` - Add players to appropriate queues
- `TryCreateMatch(GameMode mode)` - Create matches based on mode rules
- `ProcessMatch(Match match)` - Handle match outcomes and stat updates

### Display & Management Methods

- `DisplayQueueStatus()` - Show all queue information with formatting
- `DisplayPlayerStats(Player player)` - Show detailed player information
- `GetQueueEstimate(GameMode mode)` - Calculate estimated wait times

_All other classes and UI components are provided - focus on these core methods!_

## üìù Detailed Requirements

### 1. Queue Management Logic

- **Casual Mode**: Any two players can match (simple FIFO)
- **Ranked Mode**: Players within ¬±2 skill levels can match
- **QuickPlay Mode**: Prefer skill matching, but allow any match if queue is long
- **Always handle empty queues** with helpful error messages

### 2. Match Processing

- **Win probability** based on skill difference (higher skill = better chance)
- **Skill rating updates**: +1 for win, -1 for loss (minimum 1, maximum 10)
- **Statistics tracking**: Update wins, losses, and match history
- **Match validation**: Ensure valid players and outcomes

### 3. Input Validation

- Validate player names (no duplicates, not empty)
- Validate skill ratings (1-10 range)
- Handle queue operations gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages for invalid operations

## üß™ Testing Requirements

Your application must handle these scenarios:

### Basic Matchmaking Tests

1. Create multiple players with different skill levels
2. Add players to different queues
3. Process matches and verify correct pairing
4. Check that statistics update properly

### Game Mode Tests

1. **Casual**: Any players should match regardless of skill
2. **Ranked**: Only players within ¬±2 skill levels should match
3. **QuickPlay**: Prefer skill matching but allow broader matching

### Edge Case Tests

1. Try to create matches with empty queues
2. Single player in queue (no match possible)
3. All players same skill level in ranked
4. Queue status display with various queue states

- Test each queue mode independently
- Verify skill-based matching works correctly
- Test edge cases thoroughly

## üîç Research and Problem Solving

**No external resources or links are provided intentionally!** This assignment is designed to encourage you to develop essential programming research skills.

**When you get stuck, GOOGLE IT!** This is a critical skill for any developer. Examples of effective searches:

- `"How to iterate through a queue in C#"`
- `"C# Queue<T> peek without removing"`
- `"C# switch statement with enum"`
- `"How to remove specific item from Queue C#"`
- `"C# LINQ where clause filtering"`

**Remember**: Stack Overflow, Microsoft Docs, and C# documentation are your friends. Learning to find solutions independently is just as important as implementing them!

## üéì Real-World Applications

This assignment teaches concepts used in:

- **Online gaming** (League of Legends, Overwatch matchmaking)
- **Ride-sharing apps** (Uber, Lyft driver-passenger pairing)
- **Food delivery** (DoorDash, Uber Eats order-driver matching)
- **Dating apps** (compatibility-based matching systems)
- **Job platforms** (skill-based candidate-employer matching)

---

**Remember**: This assignment is about applying Lab 6 concepts to solve a real problem. Focus on understanding multi-queue management and how different queues can have different processing rules while maintaining fairness!

**Good luck building your matchmaking system! üéÆ**
